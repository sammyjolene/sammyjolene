### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, an enthusiastic and curious software developer. In the past I have been a marketer, entrepreneur, educator and volunteer coordinator. I just completed a 12 week retreat with [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). I'm a certified Tennessee Naturalist and have an MBA. Once upon a time I was fluent in Mandarin and lived in China. These days you can find me outside looking at bugs, on a mushroom foray, trying to ID birds or taking far too many pictures of flowers.
